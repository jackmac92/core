# Criteria for "gibberish" detection:
# 1. Contains only alphanumeric characters
# 2. Has a mix of numbers and letters
# 3. No recognizable words (simplified check - assumes gibberish won't have 3+ consecutive consonants or vowels)

# Check if filename contains non alphanumeric characters
if ! [[ "$basename" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$ ]]; then
    exit 1
fi

# Check if filename has both letters and numbers
if ! [[ "$basename" =~ [a-zA-Z] ]] || ! [[ "$basename" =~ [0-9] ]]; then
    exit 1

# Check for patterns that suggest real words:
# - 3 or more consecutive vowels (rare in English)
# - 4 or more consecutive consonants (rare in English)
if [[ "$basename" =~ [aeiou]{3} ]] || [[ "$basename" =~ [^aeiou]{4} ]]; then
